<p>This program is designed to improve the estimation of causal
effects via an extremely powerful method of matching that is widely
applicable and exceptionally easy to understand and use (if you
understand how to draw a histogram, you will understand this method).
The program implements the Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) algorithm
described in

Exact Matching</a>"</span> (Abstract: <a

</blockquote>

Matching is a nonparametric method of preprocessing data to control
for some or all of the potentially confounding influence of
pretreatment control variables by reducing imbalance between the
treated and control groups.  After preprocessing in this way, any
method of analysis that would have been used without matching can be
applied to estimate causal effects, although some methods will have
even better properties.  CEM is a Monotonoic Imbalance Bounding (MIB)
matching method --- which means that the balance between the treated
and control groups is chosen by the user ex ante rather than
discovered through the usual laborious process of checking after the
fact and repeatedly reestimating, and so that adjusting the imbalance
on one variable has no effect on the maximum imbalance of any other.
CEM also strictly bounds through ex ante user choice both the degree
of model dependence and the average treatment effect estimation error,
eliminates the need for a separate procedure to restrict data to
common empirical support, meets the congruence principle, is robust to
measurement error, works well with multiple imputation methods for
missing data, can be completely automated, and is extremely fast
computationally even with very large data sets.  After preprocessing
data with CEM, the analyst may then use a simple difference in means
or whatever statistical model they would have applied without
matching.  CEM also works well for multicategory treatments,
determining blocks in experimental designs, and evaluating extreme
counterfactuals.
