\description{
Plot of imbalance space diagnostic tool for CEM
}
\usage{
imbspace.plot(obj, group="1", data, explore=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{obj}{an object of class \code{imbalance.space}}
  \item{group}{character string denoting group id. Defaults to \code{"1"}.}
  \item{data}{data for running additional matching solutions.}
  \item{explore}{if \code{TRUE} the user can interact and find new solutions.}
}

\details{
For an interactive device a two panels plot is given. On the left panel
the user can select a CEM solution and the number of cutpoints
used in that matching solution is plotted as a parallel plot on the right
plot. On exit (right-click on the left panel), the function returns
all the cem solutions highlighted in the last selection of the user.

For non-interactive devices, only the space of the solutions are plotted.

This plot shows the tradeoff in matching as a function of
imbalance and sample size.

The imbalance of the raw data is represented as a red plot and the initial
CEM solution as a green plot. All solutions below the green dot and left to
it are better than the user choice in terms of imbalance and number of
units matched.

} 
\value{
  \item{tab}{an invisible object containing the selection of cem solutions and their
  coarsenings.}
