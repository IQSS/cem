\description{
Heuristic search of the best propensity score model specification
}
\usage{
pscoreSelect(formula, data, C.L=2*(pnorm(-1,0,1)), C.Q=0.1) 
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{the original data.}
  \item{formula}{formula type specification.}
  \item{C.L}{if at leat one likelihood ration test statistic is greater
  than \code{C.L}, then the covariate with higher likelihood ration test statistic
  is added linearly to the model.}
  \item{C.Q}{if the highest likelihood ratio statistic is greater than \code{C.Q},
  then interaction terms are included in the pscore model specification.}
}

\details{
This is a tool to help the user to the search for the best
propensity score model specification along the lines
suggested by Imbens and Rubin (forthcoming). The output of the function is
a model formula to be passed to \code{glm} or such, in order
to estimate the propensity score model and then perform 
propensity score matching.

This tool is useful in combination with \code{\link{imbspace.plot}}.

\value{
