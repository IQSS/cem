This R package is designed to improve the estimation of causal effects via an extremely powerful method of matching that is widely applicable and exceptionally easy to understand and use (if you understand how to draw a histogram, you will understand this method). The program implements the Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) algorithm described in:

Stefano M. Iacus, Gary King, and Giuseppe Porro, "*Causal Inference Without Balance Checking: Coarsened Exact Matching*" and "*Multivariate Matching Methods That are Monotonic Imbalance Bounding*".
